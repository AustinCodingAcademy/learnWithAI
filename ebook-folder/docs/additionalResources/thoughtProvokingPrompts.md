## TIPS OF THE DAY: 

- [ ] **Use ++ctrl++ + ++f++ to Search within the Chat**: If you’re working through a long conversation or series of prompts, use ++ctrl++ + ++f++ (or ++cmd++ + ++f++ on Mac) to quickly find a specific term or topic in the chat. This can save time if you're referencing past answers.
- [ ] **Ask ChatGPT to respond in different tones** (e.g., formal, casual, humorous) to suit the context or to keep the learning process engaging. *Example: "Explain how blockchain works as if you're telling a funny story."*
- [ ] **Use Role-Playing for Deeper Insights**: Instruct ChatGPT to take on a specific role (e.g., a mentor, interviewer, CEO, or domain expert) to get insights from a certain perspective *Example: "Pretend you’re a product design mentor. How would you guide a beginner through the process of designing a prototype?"*
- [ ] **Leverage Preceding Context**: You don’t always have to restate everything. You can reference previous parts of the conversation. For example, after asking a complex question and getting an answer, follow up with: *"Can you give me a real-world example of that?"* or *"How can I apply this to a Python project?"* ChatGPT will often understand the context from the preceding exchange.
- [ ] **Use Comments in Code Requests**: Ask ChatGPT to include comments when generating code, so you can better understand the purpose of each section. *Example: "Can you provide a Python example of a binary search algorithm with comments explaining each step?"*
- [ ] **Ask for the Response in Different Formats**: If you need an answer in a specific format (e.g., a table, JSON, code), ask ChatGPT to output it that way. *Example: "Can you provide this information in a table format?" or "Give me a JSON example for this data structure."*
- [ ] **Use Code Blocks for Coding Questions**: When asking coding-related questions, enclose code snippets within triple backticks (```) to format them properly. This makes it easier for ChatGPT to understand and generate well-formatted code in response. 

>*Example: Here's the code I’m struggling with:*
    ```python
    def factorial(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
    ```
> *Can you explain why this works and how recursion is applied?*

- [ ] **Use “Continue” for Lengthy Responses**: If the response gets cut off, simply type “Continue” to pick up where ChatGPT left off. It’s helpful when asking for long explanations or extensive lists. *Example: After receiving part of an explanation, just type “Continue” to get the rest.*
