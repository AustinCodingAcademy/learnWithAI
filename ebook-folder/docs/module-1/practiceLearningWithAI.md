Let‚Äôs dive in and see how ChatGPT can be your byte-driven-mentor, guiding you from curious beginner to confident pro!

## Coding: From Zero to JavaScript Hero

Learning to code is like tackling a big Lego set. At first, you‚Äôre staring at a pile of colorful bricks with no clue where to start. But soon, with the right guidance, you‚Äôre building castles and catapults like a champ. Here‚Äôs where ChatGPT comes in: it‚Äôs like that trusty Lego instruction booklet‚Äîbut better! You can ask broad, beginner questions and then get progressively more specific as you refine your coding knowledge.

Here‚Äôs how to get the ball rolling:

> **FOLLOW-ALONG**: Each of these example are not here for you to read but instead for you to practice. Open up ChatGPT or your [ACA AI Web Tutor](https://chatbottutor-7e7843ea9900.herokuapp.com/) and copy/paste these prompts in. That way you'll see how they are actually useful to you.

=== "1. Start broad:"

    **Prompt 1:**
        
        What‚Äôs JavaScript, and why should I learn it?

    This is your entry point‚Äîunderstanding the big picture before diving into the nitty-gritty. Copy/Paste into an AI and read. What's it say?


=== "2. Narrow it down"

    **Prompt 2:**

        How do variables work in JavaScript?

    What did you learn? Think of variables as the little containers where you store your Lego pieces before using them to build cool structures (a.k.a. your code).

=== "3. Practice It" 

    **Prompt 3:**

        Show me an example of a simple JavaScript function.

    You‚Äôre getting hands-on here‚Äîasking for basic code examples to see how everything fits together. What function did it give you? Do you understand it? If not, can you ask it to explain the function?

=== "4. Drill Down"

    Let‚Äôs get a bit more specific:

    **Prompt 4:**
    
        How can I create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle?

    This is like building a specific part of your Lego project. You‚Äôre not building random stuff anymore ‚Äî you have a goal!

=== "5. Level Up"

    **Prompt 5:**

        What‚Äôs the best way to refactor this function for better performance?

    Now you‚Äôre in pro territory. ChatGPT can guide you on how to optimize your code, making it cleaner and faster.

<hr>

With each step, you‚Äôre moving from the wide-angle shot of what coding is all about to a close-up on specific concepts. ChatGPT isn‚Äôt just giving you answers; it‚Äôs your coding companion, helping you build better code one block at a time. This specificity and depth keeps going on and on and on and on. For as long as you have a career in this field, you'll have an AI buddy to explain dumb shit to you so you don't feel like a dumb shit. LOL.

## Cooking: Mac & Cheese to Michelin-Star

Okay, coding might be cool, but what if you want to feed yourself in the process? (Or, better yet, impress someone with a culinary masterpiece?) ChatGPT can do more than code; it can help you cook! Using AI to learn cooking is like having a virtual chef beside you, guiding you through the basics and helping you experiment with flavor like a kitchen alchemist.

Let‚Äôs cook up some knowledge:

=== "1. Broadly:"

    **Prompt 1:**

        Hi ChatGPT, I'm interested in learning how to cook. Could you provide me with some beginner-friendly recipes and cooking techniques?

    Like asking a master chef where to start, right? You‚Äôll get general tips about the basics, like knife skills, ingredients, and maybe the importance of not burning your food. You keeping up?

=== "2. Narrowing:"

    **Prompt 2:** 
    
        Could you help me plan 3 meals to cook this week? Keep them simple as I'm just a beginner, please.

    Are you a vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy free, halal, kosher? Add this into your prompt ;)    

=== "3. Do it:"

    **Prompt 3:**
    
        Can you guide me through cooking the second suggestion?

    Ask ChatGPT to walk you through a recipe, step by step. It‚Äôs like having a patient cooking instructor, minus the judgment. Go try it!

    **BONUS Prompt:**

        Could you give me a picture of this meal to inspire me?

=== "4. FlavorFUL"

    **Prompt 4:** 
    
        How can I improve the flavor of a basic tomato sauce?

    At this point, you‚Äôre getting more adventurous‚Äîasking how to spice things up (literally).

=== "5. *je ne sais quoi*"

    **Prompt 5:**
    
        What‚Äôs the secret to making perfect cr√®me br√ªl√©e?

    ChatGPT can break down the process so you don‚Äôt accidentally scramble your custard! What's the secret?

=== "Yummy"

    As with coding, ChatGPT helps you progress from kitchen novice to a culinary artist, moving from the broad concepts of cooking to mastering specific recipes. The next time someone asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù you‚Äôll be ready to serve up something special‚Äîwithout needing to Google ‚Äúhow to boil water.‚Äù

<!-- Prompt To Prompt

OBJECTIVE: Create a prompt that will get ChatGPT to write an article about the following:

Using AI (ChatGPT) to:
- learn how to code 
- learn how to cook
- learn how to speak French

The article will have a list of at least 5 example prompts for the person to ask ChatGPT for the person to learn these skills starting from broad moving to more specific.

STYLE: You are a fun and witty tech writer who is helping a coding bootcamp teach people how to use AI. I'd like you to write an article on the subject "Practicing How to Learn with AI". This is the third part of a series where we are teaching people "What AI is and Isn't", "How to Use AI to Learn Something New", "Practicing How to Learn with AI", and then "Advanced Proficiency Techniques to Use with AI".

I'd like the article should be in a style of relatable metaphors, breaking down concepts into digestible layers, and speaking directly to the learner in a conversational yet informative tone. Here's a sample of my writing describing the introduction of a programming course:

"What Layer of Abstraction are We?

Now that we've know about electrons passing through our phone screen and binary representing red actions, where are we actually developing? What level of abstraction are we working in if not in electrons or binary? In this course and the entire program, we'll be building websites and web apps that depend on the pre-determined structure of a computer and the protocol we've just learned about earlier. That structure and protocol are just two of the many layers of abstracted tools that we get to use to build!

To answer the question, in web development we are working at the 10th layer of abstraction.

1st - Electrons and Transistors
2nd - DRAM memory and a [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) using binary(1s & 0s)
3rd - Bits & Bytes
4th - Logic Gates - [AND, NOT, NAND, OR, XOR, ADDER](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/logic-gate-AND-OR-XOR-NOT-NAND-NOR-and-XNOR)
5th - Functions - small packets of instructions
6th - Operating System - computing the memory with functions
7th - Service Workers - small but massively important programs that keep your computer running smoothly
8th - Interpreters - programs used to interpret instructions from other apps into binary
9th - Browser App - an app that interprets your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visual elements with executable actions.
10th - HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS

IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FIRST 9 LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION! Use this list to appreciate the work many scientists and engineers have done to create the environment we are lucky to inherit and develop within AND to know that this layers of abstraction create the fundamentals of how computers operate and communicate with one another. This means that our HTML, CSS, and JS code is just following the same foundational principals of computer science. Now all that's left to do is learn to use these abstracted tools(layers) to build website and web apps!

To learn and use these tools/abstractions doesn't require CS degrees or knowledge of bits, bytes, interpreters, or service workers. It only requires you to see this development world from two perspectives at the same time while keeping another idea in mind, Object Modeling."

IMPORTANT: Use the COSTAR technique to create this prompt
