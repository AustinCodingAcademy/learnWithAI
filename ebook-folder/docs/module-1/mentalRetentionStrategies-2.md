# Reinforcing Learning with ChatGPT, pt. 2 of 2

In 1956, Benjamin Bloom, an education psychologist, organized learning into six categories: **Remembering**, **Understanding**, **Applying**, **Analyzing**, **Evaluating**, and **Creating**. 

Each step builds on the one before, guiding learners from simple recall of information to deeper, more complex skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. This structured approach promotes a more comprehensive learning process, fostering not just knowledge acquisition but also the ability to use and create new knowledge.

What this means for you is that you have even more ways in expand your learning and value. After practicing **remembering** with quizzes and flashcards, you demonstrated **understanding** with your reflections, then you **applied** what you learned through building. Now you can move into **Analyzing**, **Evaluating**, and finally **Creating** (which you get to do all on your own!). Let's dig in.

## The Feynman Technique

Richard Feynman was a renowned American physicist known for his contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. [The Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) is a learning method where you teach a concept in simple terms as if explaining it to someone else, breaking it down until you fully understand it yourself.

It's a great approach for mastering complex topics!

### ChatGPT will Listen

You can pretend ChatGPT is your curious student, ready to listen and critique your explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
     
    Let me explain how electrical circuits work. Can you critique my explanation and point out gaps?

When you teach, you’ll quickly discover areas where you’re a bit shaky—and that’s where the real learning happens. Mic Drop.

## Test It Out IRL

Theory is great, but applying concepts in real scenarios is where the rubber meets the road. ChatGPT can give you real-world project ideas to help put your knowledge to work.

### ChatGPT for Problem-Solving

Ask for challenges that simulate real-world scenarios.

**Example Prompt:**
 
    Give me a real-world project idea that involves using React.js to solve a user interface challenge.

You can even ask ChatGPT to guide you step by step:

**Example Prompt:**
 
    Lay out the steps I need to take to build this project with React.js. Take your time and be sure to make sure the steps are correct.

Each step reinforces your learning as you apply the concepts in practical ways.

## Growth in Real-Time

### Tracking Growth

Your learning journey isn’t static. Ask ChatGPT to track your progress and help you adjust your learning strategies. ChatGPT keeps up with a memory of all of your prompts and what it has shared with you. Armed with this memory, ChatGPT can speak directly to you and give you insights on where you are, check it out:

**Example Prompt:**
 
    Track my learning progress in Python over the last two weeks and suggest areas for me to focus on.

### Personalized Learning Adjustments

ChatGPT’s feedback can help you fine-tune your approach, whether it’s spending more time on tricky topics or adjusting your learning method.

**Example:**
     
    Based on my recent quizzes, which topics need more attention?

## Conclusion

Reinforcing learning with ChatGPT offers a dynamic, interactive approach to deepening your knowledge and honing your skills. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy as a guide, you’ve progressed from basic recall all the way to advanced problem-solving and creative application. Whether you're teaching concepts using the Feynman Technique, testing your knowledge with real-world projects, or tracking your progress over time, ChatGPT serves as both a tutor and a learning partner.

As you continue your journey, remember that learning is iterative, and the ability to adjust, reflect, and apply new knowledge is what transforms you from a student into a master of your craft. With each step, you’re not just absorbing information—you’re refining your ability to think critically, solve problems, and innovate. So keep pushing forward, using ChatGPT as your companion in the pursuit of growth and discovery!

> TIP OF THE DAY: **Use Code Blocks for Coding Questions**: When asking coding-related questions, enclose code snippets within triple backticks (```) to format them properly. This makes it easier for ChatGPT to understand and generate well-formatted code in response. 

>*Example: Here's the code I’m struggling with:*
    ```python
    def factorial(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
    ```
