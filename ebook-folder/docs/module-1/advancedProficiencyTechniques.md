## Advanced Proficiency Techniques

> TIP OF THE DAY: **Use “Continue” for Lengthy Responses**: If the response gets cut off, simply type “Continue” to pick up where ChatGPT left off. It’s helpful when asking for long explanations or extensive lists. *Example: After receiving part of an explanation, just type “Continue” to get the rest.*

<!-- Prompt-to-Prompt 

OBJECTIVE: Create a prompt that will get ChatGPT to write an article titled "Advanced Proficiency Techniques for Learning with ChatGPT".

The article will have a list of at least 5 example prompts for the person to ask ChatGPT for the person to learn these skills starting from broad moving to more specific.

STYLE: You are a fun and witty tech writer who is helping a coding bootcamp teach people how to use AI. I'd like you to write an article on the subject "Practicing How to Learn with AI". This is the third part of a series where we are teaching people "What AI is and Isn't", "How to Use AI to Learn Something New", "Practicing How to Learn with AI", and then "Advanced Proficiency Techniques to Use with AI".

I'd like the article should be in a style of relatable metaphors, breaking down concepts into digestible layers, and speaking directly to the learner in a conversational yet informative tone. Here's a sample of my writing describing the introduction of a programming course:

"What Layer of Abstraction are We?

Now that we've know about electrons passing through our phone screen and binary representing red actions, where are we actually developing? What level of abstraction are we working in if not in electrons or binary? In this course and the entire program, we'll be building websites and web apps that depend on the pre-determined structure of a computer and the protocol we've just learned about earlier. That structure and protocol are just two of the many layers of abstracted tools that we get to use to build!

To answer the question, in web development we are working at the 10th layer of abstraction.

1st - Electrons and Transistors
2nd - DRAM memory and a [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) using binary(1s & 0s)
3rd - Bits & Bytes
4th - Logic Gates - [AND, NOT, NAND, OR, XOR, ADDER](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/logic-gate-AND-OR-XOR-NOT-NAND-NOR-and-XNOR)
5th - Functions - small packets of instructions
6th - Operating System - computing the memory with functions
7th - Service Workers - small but massively important programs that keep your computer running smoothly
8th - Interpreters - programs used to interpret instructions from other apps into binary
9th - Browser App - an app that interprets your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visual elements with executable actions.
10th - HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS

IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FIRST 9 LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION! Use this list to appreciate the work many scientists and engineers have done to create the environment we are lucky to inherit and develop within AND to know that this layers of abstraction create the fundamentals of how computers operate and communicate with one another. This means that our HTML, CSS, and JS code is just following the same foundational principals of computer science. Now all that's left to do is learn to use these abstracted tools(layers) to build website and web apps!

To learn and use these tools/abstractions doesn't require CS degrees or knowledge of bits, bytes, interpreters, or service workers. It only requires you to see this development world from two perspectives at the same time while keeping another idea in mind, Object Modeling."
