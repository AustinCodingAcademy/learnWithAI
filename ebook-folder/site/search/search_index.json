This can save time if you're referencing past answers. Ask ChatGPT to respond in different tones (e.g., formal, casual, humorous) to suit the context or to keep the learning process engaging. Example: \"Explain how blockchain works as if you're telling a funny story.\" Use Role-Playing for Deeper Insights : Instruct ChatGPT to take on a specific role (e.g., a mentor, interviewer, CEO, or domain expert) to get insights from a certain perspective Example: \"Pretend you\u2019re a product design mentor. How would you guide a beginner through the process of designing a prototype?\" Leverage Preceding Context : You don\u2019t always have to restate everything. You can reference previous parts of the conversation. For example, after asking a complex question and getting an answer, follow up with: \"Can you give me a real-world example of that?\" or \"How can I apply this to a Python project?\" ChatGPT will often understand the context from the preceding exchange. Use Comments in Code Requests : Ask ChatGPT to include comments when generating code, so you can better understand the purpose of each section. Example: \"Can you provide a Python example of a binary search algorithm with comments explaining each step?\" Ask for the Response in Different Formats : If you need an answer in a specific format (e.g., a table, JSON, code), ask ChatGPT to output it that way. Example: \"Can you provide this information in a table format?\" or \"Give me a JSON example for this data structure.\" Use Code Blocks for Coding Questions : When asking coding-related questions, enclose code snippets within triple backticks (```) to format them properly. This makes it easier for ChatGPT to understand and generate well-formatted code in response. Example: Here's the code I\u2019m struggling with: 1 2 3 4 5 def factorial ( n ): if n == 1 : return 1 else : return n * factorial ( n - 1 ) Can you explain why this works and how recursion is applied?

But what if it could be that gentle ( or firm ) nudge you need to stay on track? Imagine having an accountability partner that never forgets, always checks in, and adjusts to your pace \u2014 ChatGPT can be just that, making sure you keep moving, even on those \"meh\" days. In this article, let's explore how to turn ChatGPT into your personal study coach, helping you create goals, track progress, and hit those key milestones with ease. Let's dive in! Creating and Adapting a Long-Term Study Plan with ChatGPT A long-term study plan is like that GPS for your learning journey \u2014 you need directions, but you also need flexibility to reroute when, ya know...life happens. ChatGPT can map out this learning roadmap with precision and help you adjust when needed. Basic Prompt : 1 Help me create a 3-month plan to learn Python. This gives you a basic structure, but we can do better. Let\u2019s get more specific: Advanced Prompt : 1 Help me create a 3-month plan to master Python for data analysis, with checkpoints every two weeks to review my progress and make adjustments as needed. Make sure to include time for hands-on projects and a final assessment. See how that opens up a more interactive journey? You\u2019ve got clear goals, checkpoints, and room to tweak things along the way. Setting Milestones and Goals for Consistent Progress Big goals are exciting\u2014until they become overwhelming. That\u2019s where ChatGPT comes in handy for breaking things down into bite-sized pieces. Think of it as chunking your learning into manageable levels. Basic Prompt : 1 Help me learn machine learning in 8 weeks. Cool, but... where are the details? Let\u2019s level up: Follow-Up Prompt : 1 Help me break down my goal to learn machine learning in 8 weeks into weekly milestones, with specific tasks like reading, coding exercises, and testing my models. Remind me every Monday of my progress and suggest adjustments if I\u2019m behind. Now you\u2019re cooking with gas! It\u2019s easier to stay consistent when you\u2019ve got small wins each week and someone ( ahem, ChatGPT ) to keep you on track. Using AI for Spaced Repetition and Active Recall Ever heard of spaced repetition? It\u2019s like watering a plant at just the right intervals \u2014 too soon, and you\u2019re wasting time; too late, and things wither. ChatGPT can be your personal green thumbed neighbor for learning, making sure you review at optimal intervals. Basic Prompt : 1 Remind me to review React.js concepts. Helpful, but you can do better: Advanced Prompt : 1 Help me set up a spaced repetition schedule for reviewing React.js concepts, with reminders every 3 days for active recall, coding exercises, and quizzes to reinforce key concepts. This way, ChatGPT doesn\u2019t just remind you to review \u2014 it actively keeps your brain engaged through quizzes and exercises. Learning React just got a whole lot smarter! Goal Tracking: Keeping Yourself Accountable with Clear, Measurable Goals It\u2019s easy to lose sight of progress when there\u2019s no one asking, \"How\u2019s that coming along?\" ChatGPT can be your accountability partner, nudging you with measurable goals that give you a clear picture of where you stand. Basic Prompt : 1 Check in with me about my project. Not bad, but let\u2019s turbocharge it: Advanced Prompt : 1 \"Every Monday, ask me how I\u2019m progressing on my Raspberry Pi project. Track my progress and suggest next steps or resources if I\u2019m falling behind. If I\u2019m ahead, suggest advanced tasks to challenge myself.\" Boom! Now you\u2019ve got a system that not only keeps you accountable but also adapts to your pace, pushing you to level up when you\u2019re ready. Personalized Study Schedules Consistency is the name of the game, and a personalized study schedule is your secret weapon. Let ChatGPT handle the scheduling so you can focus on learning, not on juggling calendars. Basic Prompt : 1 Make me a study schedule for JavaScript. That\u2019s okay for starters, but why not be more? Advanced Prompt : 1 Create a weekly study plan for learning JavaScript, with dedicated time for coding practice, review sessions, and mini-projects. Include breaks and realistic time slots based on my availability from 6 PM to 8 PM daily. With a personalized schedule that fits your life, you\u2019re setting yourself up for success. Plus, ChatGPT can tweak it when things change! Progress Check-Ins and Realignment Let\u2019s be real: we all veer off track sometimes. Using the memory of your chats, ChatGPT can check in regularly to help you realign if you\u2019re straying from your goals. Consider it your compass, helping you recalibrate. Basic Prompt : 1 Remind me to check my progress every now and then. You deserve better: Advanced Prompt : 1 Every Wednesday, check in on my progress with 3D printing. If I\u2019m behind, suggest adjustments to my schedule or offer alternative resources to help me catch up. If I\u2019m on track, recommend advanced topics or projects. This keeps you not just on track, but always moving forward\u2014whether you need to speed up or slow down. Reminders for Specific Study Tasks Let\u2019s face it: sometimes we just need a nudge. ChatGPT is great at sending reminders so those critical study sessions don\u2019t slip through the cracks. Basic Prompt : 1 Remind me to review my notes. Really...? You know better. Advanced Prompt : 1 Every Thursday at 5 PM, remind me to review my product design notes and practice prototyping for 30 minutes. Include a question I should try to answer based on what I\u2019ve learned so far. Not only are you reminded, but you\u2019re also given a task to reinforce your learning. Conclusion At the end of the day, ChatGPT isn\u2019t just your assistant \u2014 it\u2019s your personal study coach, accountability partner, and productivity booster all wrapped in one. With clear goals, personalized schedules, regular check-ins, and a system to review and adapt, you\u2019ve got everything you need to crush your learning goals.

Of course not. Learning works the same way. Instead of trying to absorb everything at once, break it into chunks. ChatGPT is awesome at this! You can ask for bite-sized pieces of info, then build from there. Metaphor Moment : Think of learning like building a LEGO set. You wouldn\u2019t dump the whole box out and expect a castle to magically appear. Instead, you build section by section\u2014same with your brain. Practical Example: Ask: 1 ChatGPT, can you break down the steps to understanding how blockchain technology works in simple, digestible parts? Try it yourself. What'd you get? Don\u2019t Be Shy! Here\u2019s the deal: ChatGPT can be like that friend who gives you a good answer, but with a little push, they\u2019ll give you a great answer. Asking follow-up questions is your secret sauce. Let\u2019s say you ask, \u201cWhat is machine learning?\u201d You\u2019ll probably get a textbook-like answer. But don\u2019t stop there! You can push ChatGPT further with follow-up questions like, \u201cCan you break that down with an example?\u201d or \u201cHow is this used in the real world?\u201d Example Chat 1: You: What is machine learning? ChatGPT: Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. You: Cool! Can you give me an example? ChatGPT: Sure! Imagine you\u2019re using Netflix. Machine learning algorithms analyze what you watch and suggest shows you might like based on your viewing habits. Boom\u2014now you have something tangible to work with. This technique can be used to refine and deepen your understanding across any subject. Enhancing Your Problem-Solving Here\u2019s a wild thought: ChatGPT isn\u2019t a search engine. It\u2019s more like that study buddy who\u2019s great at thinking things through (and as a bonus, doesn\u2019t mind if you ask the same question five different ways). Say you\u2019re stuck on a tricky coding problem, like how to optimize your Python code for performance. Instead of asking just one broad question, you can engage ChatGPT like this: Example Chat 2: You: How do I optimize my Python code? ChatGPT: Some ways to optimize Python code include using list comprehensions, minimizing the use of global variables, and leveraging built-in functions. You: Can you show me an example of optimizing a loop? ChatGPT: Sure! Here\u2019s a before-and-after example\u2026 By asking follow-up questions, you\u2019re teaching yourself to think critically and problem-solve in layers. Ah...value add. ChatGPT, Thought Partner ChatGPT can be more than just a Q&A machine. Treat it like a brainstorming buddy, helping you come up with ideas and solutions. This is especially useful for creative tasks like product design or coding projects. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re designing a smart water bottle that tracks hydration levels (because, hey, staying hydrated is serious business!). ChatGPT can help you brainstorm ideas. Example Chat 3: You : I want to design a smart water bottle that tracks hydration levels. Can you help me brainstorm some features? ChatGPT : Absolutely! You could include a built-in sensor that tracks the amount of water consumed and syncs with a mobile app to show daily hydration goals. Consider adding LED indicators on the bottle to remind users to drink, or even a temperature gauge to keep track of water temperature. Co-creating with ChatGPT means bouncing ideas back and forth\u2014you don\u2019t have to do it alone! What else could you ask about this water tracking bottle? Alternative Perspectives We all know that the first solution isn\u2019t always the best. ChatGPT is great for helping you think outside the box by offering alternative approaches. Example Chat 4: You: I\u2019m trying to reduce the energy usage of my Raspberry Pi project. What are my options? ChatGPT: You could consider underclocking the CPU, disabling unnecessary services, or optimizing your code to run more efficiently. You: Great, any other alternatives that are less technical? ChatGPT: Sure! You could try using a more energy-efficient power supply or simply putting the Raspberry Pi in sleep mode when it's not in use.

No, not apps yet but trust that the technology used for apps is the same technology used to build website and anything you'll ever want to build in the future, is also built on the foundations we'll learn in this course..... What is the Internet? The internet is a continuous connection of various computers and devices that includes your phone, computer, watch, and doorbell, etc... How Does it Work? In order for these devices to talk to one another they must rely on a series of steps that detail how, when, and what data transfers look like. More here... Three Jobs of a Web Developer At any given point of a web developer's typical work day they are doing one these three jobs: 1 - Storing Data 2 - Moving & Manipulating Data 3 - Rendering Data Ways of Thinking The way computers work does seem like magic. more here... What Layer of Abstraction are We? Now that we've know about electrons passing through our phone screen and binary representing red actions, where are we actually developing? What level of abstraction are we working in if not in electrons or binary? In this course and the entire program, we'll be building websites and web apps that depend on the pre-determined structure of a computer and the protocol we've just learned about earlier. That structure and protocol are just two of the many layers of abstracted tools that we get to use to build! To answer the question, in web development we are working at the 10th layer of abstraction. 1st - Electrons and Transistors 2nd - DRAM memory and a CPU using binary(1s & 0s) 3rd - Bits & Bytes 4th - Logic Gates - AND, NOT, NAND, OR, XOR, ADDER 5th - Functions - small packets of instructions 6th - Operating System - computing the memory with functions 7th - Service Workers - small but massively important programs that keep your computer running smoothly 8th - Interpreters - programs used to interpret instructions from other apps into binary 9th - Browser App - an app that interprets your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visual elements with executable actions. 10th - HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FIRST 9 LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION! Use this list to appreciate the work many scientists and engineers have done to create the environment we are lucky to inherit and develop within AND to know that this layers of abstraction create the fundamentals of how computers operate and communicate with one another. This means that our HTML, CSS, and JS code is just following the same foundational principals of computer science. Now all that's left to do is learn to use these abstracted tools(layers) to build website and web apps! To learn and use these tools/abstractions doesn't require CS degrees or knowledge of bits, bytes, interpreters, or service workers. It only requires you to see this development world from two perspectives at the same time while keeping another idea in mind, Object Modeling. The Two Perspectives + Object Modeling Perspective One: Objects are how the computer keeps up with memory and interacts with the world and people around it? Perspective Two: We use code to organize our thoughts about how to access that memory and give instructions on what to do with that memory to both the computer and other human-beings(fellow developers). In the next session we'll explore the following questions: 1 2 * How do we accomplish the invisible task of seeing the memory of computers? * How does code represent our programming intentions to the computer? To do this we'll break them down in three parts: Objects, Object Modeling, Code as Communication. Part One: Objects Computers don't have eyes or ears...yet. Part Two: Object Modeling. Object Modeling... try it! Draw a large box nearly the size of a sheet of notebook paper. At the top label it window . Inside draw another box nearly 3/4 the size of the first box. Label this one document . > Inside the window box create two lists titled: \"Properties\" & \"Methods\" > Under the \"Properties\" list write down the first five properties you find at this website: W3S Window Object NOTICE: The 2nd property is \"Console\" and the 4th is \"Document\" These are two objects you've already come across; the \"Console\" is the one you opened in your Inspect > Developer Tools earlier and typed \"window\". And the \"Document\" is the other box on your page!! > In the \"Methods\" list write the first 5 methods you see on that same website: W3S Window Object > Repeat these steps for the smaller box, the \"Document\" object, but with this page instead: W3S Document Object NOTE: the ones with parenthesis() following them are methods and the ones without are properties. What you see on your paper is a simple model of two objects, Window and Document, and shorts lists of each of their properties and methods. This is Object Modeling. And this is how we will talk about EVERYTHING we learn. Everything is an object with properties, methods, and events. To continue on this Object Modeling exploration we'll need to cover some new terms: Properties , Methods , and Events . These three new terms are called the members of an object. Properties All objects have properties . Properties are descriptions of the object. If you were an object you would have properties that might include: name: , gender: , height: , weight: , age: , DOB: , job: . The same goes for our web page objects. All visible objects have color: , height: , width: , z-index: , font-size: , etc... Properties are things that describe what something is, what it contains, and what it looks like when rendered. You'll also see properties referred to as attributes and keys while the value that is assigned to each of them (the part after the colon and before comma) is called a value leading to the common expression: key/value pairs , i.e. name: \"Rebecca\", , age: 33, or width: 500px, Methods Most objects have methods . Methods are like special properties in that they don't describe the object but instead they describe actions the object can do! You might have methods like eat() , sleep() , run() , and beStill() . However, as you saw in your exercise, objects on our web pages might have methods like: confirm() , clearInterval() , createElement() , execCommand() and open() because they are computer object-things and not human-being things with needs like food, water, and shelter. Methods are also called built-in functions because they work like functions. They're small sets of instructions that can be executed just like other functions. Now, we haven't fully covered functions yet but suffice it to say that if you just learned how to mix cocktails you would now have two new functions written into your system that are maybe called: mixIngredients() and shakeVigoursly() . So every time you need to make a cocktail for your party you would first call mixIngredients() then shakeVigoursly() . Not everyone needs or want to learn how to make cocktails but everyone needs to eat, sleep, and drink. So the good Lord gave us all built-in functions/ methods called: sleep() , eat() , and drink() . In web development, the reason we have methods is because some functions need to be called regularly, by all developers for most apps and don't need to be special or customized. So the engineers of HTML created \"built-in functions\" that are readily available to be used by us. The \"built-in\" functions are methods . Events Most objects also have a third category of members : Events . You can think of events as interactions. Interactions that happen between objects and other objects or objects and humans. See, we can move our mouse, place our icon on an element on our screen, and click on that icon. In that single move there are three distinct events/interactions that happen: 1) onmousemove , onmouseenter , and onmousedown . The events are built into object so that they can be interacted with. We have event like: lookedAt , smiledAt , handShaked , poked , hugged , shoved , greeted . All of these are ways in which our bodies are interacted with the world around them. In web development terms, these Events are used to \"capture\" an interaction and then do something because of it. For the most part all of these built-in events are attached to a \"blank\"; in that, they fire every time the event happens but nothing is triggered. It's up to us, the developer to create reactions and then attach them to the the events. So we might say something like: onmouseenter=\"openGreetingWindow()\" . This could be equivalent to our bodies being programmed with: smiledAt=\"smileBack()\" . At this point you may be a bit confused on the difference between methods and events so for now separate them by this distinctions: 1 2 3 * Events capture interactions with the object from the outside world, in order for us to attach instructions to be carried out when the event happens. * Methods are actions the the object can take to outwardly interact with the world. * And properties are bits information that describe the object. While object modeling is a great way to understand how a computer interacts with the world it is not how we communicate to the computer our programming intentions. The computer, frankly doesn't know anything about this Object Modeling stuff. It just knows about objects because what we interpret as a \"model\" is the complete and total reality of a computer. It knows nothing else. Because of this, we have to use a language that communicates to the computer our intentions with its objects their subsequent properties, methods, and events. This language is what generally call code . The great thing about learning code now is that you've already built-thing with three different coding languages and you've been reading code in all of these textual examples. Part Three: Code as Communication. In order for us to communicate our programming needs and intentions we need a language that can be interpreted by the computer and understood by humans. This is what we call code . Code comes in many different names and flavors that we call languages, or programming languages . We use programming languages to communicate to both humans and computers what our programming needs and intentions are. Notice earlier, we used the word \"interpret\" for computers and \"understand\" for humans. This is because, as long as your fellow developers know the syntax and semantics of the language you chose to write, they will understand what you meant. But the computer must \"interpret\" what you wrote because the computer doesn't actually know JavaScript from Closure or Haskell. Our computers use interpreters that convert your programming language of choice to binary before it executes the program you built. Programming languages are similar to our human languages in that they were all created to represent and communicate our needs and intentions. It doesn't matter what language you are speaking...as long as you are speaking to someone who understands the language they will know what you're saying. This goes for computers as well. When we're building websites and web app we're talking to web browsers who know three languages: HTML, JS, and CSS. If we are building iOS apps we're talking to an operating system that understands Swift and if we're build apps for Android we're talking to a system that understands Java. All languages are built in similar ways because they all have to accomplish the same goals: store data, move data, and render data. In this way, you can feel confident that once you now how to program in JavaScript, learning to program with Python, Swift, Java, Go, or C# will come much easier! This layer of \"abstraction\" is not so important for us to learn, so much, as it is helpful for us to understand that programming languages like JavaScript are just languages with nouns, verbs, sentence structure, actions, and objects that all represent to the computer our programming needs and intention of how to we would like to move, manipulate, and display the objects our computers know about. In Summary: Our Three Jobs, Object Modeling & Code as Communication Now that we've learned our three jobs as web developers are to store, move, and render data inside an invisible world with 10 levels of abstractions with a computer that see only objects with properties, methods, & events and interprets only code it recognizes we have our work cut out for us. How do we do it? We first have to remember that our three jobs as web developers is to store data, move data, and render data. The next is to always draw out our objects on paper, whiteboard and in our mind so we don't forget that everything is an object. Third, we have to practice gratitude for the languages we get to learn and be happy that we get to create stories and books with these programming languages instead of new words for every thought. After that, we must always reference our docs. Docs are how to learn and remember object, properties, methods, and events . And lastly, we have to keep learning and trusting that we can do this!","title":"Pre-Class Lesson 1: The Internet/Web, Our Job as Developers, and Ways to Think About It"},{"location":"module-1/lessonOutlineTemplate/#pre-class-lesson-1-the-internetweb-our-job-as-developers-and-ways-to-think-about-it","text":"","title":"Pre-Class Lesson 1: The Internet/Web, Our Job as Developers, and Ways to Think About It"},{"location":"module-1/lessonOutlineTemplate/#how-the-internet-works","text":"In this course we'll be learning how to build websites.

What level of abstraction are we working in if not in electrons or binary? In this course and the entire program, we'll be building websites and web apps that depend on the pre-determined structure of a computer and the protocol we've just learned about earlier. That structure and protocol are just two of the many layers of abstracted tools that we get to use to build! To answer the question, in web development we are working at the 10th layer of abstraction. 1st - Electrons and Transistors 2nd - DRAM memory and a CPU using binary(1s & 0s) 3rd - Bits & Bytes 4th - Logic Gates - AND, NOT, NAND, OR, XOR, ADDER 5th - Functions - small packets of instructions 6th - Operating System - computing the memory with functions 7th - Service Workers - small but massively important programs that keep your computer running smoothly 8th - Interpreters - programs used to interpret instructions from other apps into binary 9th - Browser App - an app that interprets your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visual elements with executable actions. 10th - HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FIRST 9 LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION! Use this list to appreciate the work many scientists and engineers have done to create the environment we are lucky to inherit and develop within AND to know that this layers of abstraction create the fundamentals of how computers operate and communicate with one another. This means that our HTML, CSS, and JS code is just following the same foundational principals of computer science. Now all that's left to do is learn to use these abstracted tools(layers) to build website and web apps! To learn and use these tools/abstractions doesn't require CS degrees or knowledge of bits, bytes, interpreters, or service workers.

In the next session we'll explore the following questions: 1 2 * How do we accomplish the invisible task of seeing the memory of computers? * How does code represent our programming intentions to the computer?

What you see on your paper is a simple model of two objects, Window and Document, and shorts lists of each of their properties and methods. This is Object Modeling. And this is how we will talk about EVERYTHING we learn. Everything is an object with properties, methods, and events.

Properties are things that describe what something is, what it contains, and what it looks like when rendered. You'll also see properties referred to as attributes and keys while the value that is assigned to each of them (the part after the colon and before comma) is called a value leading to the common expression: key/value pairs , i.e. name: \"Rebecca\", , age: 33, or width: 500px,","title":"Properties"},{"location":"module-1/lessonOutlineTemplate/#methods","text":"Most objects have methods .

That moment is no accident \u2014 it\u2019s the result of practice, repetition, and testing what you know. In the world of learning, this is called reinforcement . Whether you're learning a new coding language, product design, or electrical engineering, the secret to real mastery is reinforcing your knowledge until it becomes second nature. And guess what? ChatGPT can be your secret weapon. Power of Reinforcement Think of learning like training for a marathon. If you only ran once, you'd barely make it past the starting line on race day. Consistency and varied practice are key. In learning, reinforcing concepts by testing yourself, reflecting, and applying real-world examples is how you build that mental endurance. The beauty of ChatGPT? ...It\u2019s your personal coach, ready to quiz you, review concepts, and help you lock in what you\u2019ve learned. By the end of this article, you'll have a toolkit of actionable strategies to reinforce your learning with ChatGPT. Let\u2019s dive in. Quizzes & Self-Assessment Why Quizzes Matter Quizzes do more than just test your knowledge \u2014 they help solidify it. By forcing yourself to recall information, you strengthen those neural pathways. Plus, quizzes reveal gaps in your understanding, so you know what to focus on next. Make Personalized Quizzes You can use ChatGPT to create quizzes that cater to your specific learning needs. Want to focus on machine learning, JavaScript, or even RaspberryPi? ChatGPT has you covered. Try these prompts out: Multiple Choice Example: 1 Create a multiple-choice quiz on machine learning algorithms. Short Answer/Open-Ended Example: 1 Give me five short-answer questions on Python functions. True/False Example: 1 Create a true/false quiz to test my knowledge of product design terminology. Self-Grading & Feedback The magic happens when you can instantly get feedback on your answers. Example: 1 Here's my solution to this JavaScript problem. Can you give me detailed feedback? With ChatGPT\u2019s feedback, you\u2019ll know where you went right\u2014or, more importantly, where you went wrong. Spaced Repetition & Active Recall Spaced Repetition? Spaced repetition is reviewing material at increasing intervals, like stretching out a rubber band just enough to snap your memory into action. ChatGPT can help remind you when it\u2019s time to revisit those key concepts. Example Prompt: 1 Help me review key concepts in data analysis, and remind me to review again in 3 days. Active Recall Active recall is another key technique. Instead of passively reviewing, you challenge yourself to retrieve information from memory. No peeking allowed! Example Prompt: 1 Quiz me on the key principles of object-oriented programming but don\u2019t show me the answers until I\u2019ve tried. Then try to answer the questions and see what you get back... By actively pulling information from your brain, you reinforce it \u2014 much like flexing that muscle until it\u2019s stronger. Deepen Your Understanding Self-Reflection Reflection helps you own your learning. It\u2019s not just about knowing the material but about understanding how and why things work. ChatGPT can act as a sounding board to help you reflect. Prompts for Reflection: 1 Help me reflect on what was challenging while learning RaspberryPi. Reviews Want to sum up what you\u2019ve learned? Example: 1 Summarize the most important concepts I should take away from today\u2019s lesson. By reviewing and reflecting on tricky concepts, you can bridge any gaps in understanding. Study Aids Flashcards Work Flashcards aren\u2019t just for cramming before exams\u2014they\u2019re a tried-and-true method for building memory over time. Flashcards w/ChatGPT Ask ChatGPT to create flashcards on any topic, and it will generate easy-to-digest cards for quick review. Try this series of prompts: Prompt 1: 1 Create a set of flashcards for key terms in product design.
